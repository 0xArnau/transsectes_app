  "how2transect": "How to do a transect",
  "how_to_1_1": "Surveys involve conducting patrols along the beach to detect possible traces of turtle nesting during the period between June 1st and October 31st.",
  "how_to_1_2": "It is recommended to carry out these patrols between 22:00 and 8:00 the following day, although the early hours of the night are the most suitable for",
  "how_to_1_title": "Transects",
  "how_to_2_1": "When a turtle emerges from the sea onto the beach to nest, it crawls using its flippers as if they were legs. This movement leaves a very distinctive track ascending towards the beach.",
  "how_to_2_2": "When it finds a suitable place, it digs the nest, lays the eggs, covers it, and returns to the sea, leaving a track with the same characteristics as the ascent but in the direction of the sea, often with a line in the middle to drag the tube through which the eggs have come out.",
  "how_to_2_3": "The ascent track may change direction as the turtle searches for a suitable place to dig the nest. The descent track is always more straight, heading directly towards the sea.",
  "how_to_2_title": "What are we looking for?",
  "how_to_3_1": "Even more challenging would be to encounter hatchlings between August and October, emerging from undetected nests and walking on the sand towards the beach. This is extremely unlikely as they hatch at night and are very small.",
  "how_to_3_2": "If we find small hatchlings or a large turtle alive or dead outside the water, we should quickly call 112.",
  "how_to_3_title": "What are we looking for?",
  "how_to_4_1": "You can bring a flashlight or headlamp with a red light, although it is rarely necessary for walking. We will use it if we are unsure about something during the transect, but moonlight is usually sufficient. Whenever possible, keep the flashlight off and walk quietly. If we do not have enough light to observe tracks, we will hold the flashlight with our arm extended towards the ground to highlight the sand relief better. Never point the flashlight towards the water, as it could scare off a turtle if there is one trying to come out.",
  "how_to_4_2": "You can put red cellophane paper on a flashlight or in front of the mobile phone flashlight.",
  "how_to_4_title": "Lighting",
  "how_to_5_1": "We can take advantage of the walk to inform and raise awareness among people or groups we encounter on the beach (athletes, families, anglers, and others) to help us by calling 112 if they witness a nesting or find tracks. Always at our discretion and willingness.",
  "how_to_5_title": "Sensitization",
  "how_to_6_1": "We will start the transect in a specific area of the beach and activate the \"START TRANSECT\" button.",
  "how_to_6_2": "We will walk along the beach, by the seashore, observing the first meters of undulating dry sand.",
  "how_to_6_title": "Start transect",
  "how_to_7_1": "Once we finish our route, we will access the section \"START TRANSECT\" and press \"FINISH TRANSECT,\" which will take us to a screen where we must fill in the following fields: if we found the beach plowed by a machine that could erase the tracks, record the number of people informed, note interesting observations, and press send.",
